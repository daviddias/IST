IST
===

Hi! I created this repo so that any student from IST (nowadays known as Tecnico ULisboa) can find the code I developed for the courses's projects and maybe take ideas from them.

If you are a student and don't understand something about the code, please fill free to open a issue, this is code that I did a long time ago (but there is nothing to be ashamed about, I hope :P), having to give it a second pass might be a good thing as well.
